        The Cobb is the ultimate composed salad, and salmon is the ultimate summer salad protein. 
        The fun you can have experimenting with different textures and flavors is practically endless. 
        This summer salmon salad pairs grilled corn and red onions with Cobb standbys like bacon, 
        avocado, and hard-boiled eggs. Salmon Cobb Salad recipe creator Justin Chapple suggests looking 
        for soil-grown greens (not hydroponic) for the best flavor.
