### Learning HTML Project: Odin Recipes

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project repository! This project showcases my journey in learning HTML through creating a collection of recipe pages. I'm excited to share my progress and improve my skills in building functional and visually appealing web pages.

#### Project Overview

Odin Recipes is an educational project aimed at exploring and practicing HTML fundamentals. Each recipe page is carefully structured to include essential information such as images, descriptions, ingredients, and detailed cooking instructions. This project not only serves as a learning experience in HTML but also enhances my ability to create clear and organized web content.

#### Key Features

- **Main Page (`index.html`)**: Lists all available recipes for easy navigation.
- **Recipe Pages (`recipes/`)**: Directory containing individual pages for each recipe.
  - Each recipe page follows a consistent layout for clarity and user-friendliness.

#### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **index.html**: Main page displaying a list of recipes.
- **recipes/**: Directory housing individual recipe pages.
  - Example file names: `lasagna.html`, `recipe2.html`, `recipe3.html`.
